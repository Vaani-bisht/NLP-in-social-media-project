# NLP-in-social-media-project
This project uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to analyze public sentiment on Twitter by classifying tweets into positive, neutral, or negative categories.

#Problem Statement
Despite the availability of vast amounts of social media data, analyzing public sentiment remains a challenge due to the unstructured, noisy, and context-sensitive nature of user-generated content. This project aims to design and implement an NLP-based system to perform sentiment analysis on a large dataset of tweets (31kâ€“41k), classifying them into positive, neutral, or negative categories. The goal is to uncover trends in public opinion, which can be valuable for businesses, policymakers, and researchers in decision-making.
